IRPNet

IRPNet is a model for classifying textual reviews into positive and negative. Completed as a bachelor's diploma work.

> <samp><mark>IRPNet</mark></samp> is an abbrevation for "<samp><mark>I</mark></samp>s <samp><mark>R</mark></samp>eview <samp><mark>P</mark></samp>ositive?"-determining <samp><mark>Net</mark></samp>work.

## Repository structure
There are two folders in repository. One is for working with data and training the model, the second is a user interface for interacting with the trained model:
- data processing:
  - `Parsing.ipynb` - parsing KinoPoisk using API to extract labeled reviews;
  - `Embedding.ipynb` - training a Word2Vec model based on all extracted KinoPoisk reviews;
  - `Preprocessing.ipynb` - forming of qualitative training dataset for a neural network;
  - `Training.ipynb` - training a neural network on a GPU using Google Colab;
  - `utils.py` - some features like timer and progress bar printing;
- interface:
  - `main.py` - CLI implementation;
  - `model.py` - classification model implementation;
  - `utils.py` - some features like colored output in CLI;
  - `parameters/` - parameters of neural network (embedding, dictionary of tokens, weights and biases).

## Usage
First of all, you need to install PyTorch:

```bash
$ pip install torch
```

Next, you need to [download](https://github.com/Ostrill/IRPNet/releases/tag/v1.0.0) a module consisting of `model.py` and a folder with model parameters, and then insert these files into your project.

After that you can use IRPNet:

```Python
from model import Model


model = Model()

example_reviews = [
    '–í—Å–µ –ø–ª–æ—Ö–æ, –Ω–µ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—É—é',   # Negative 99.392%
    '–í—Å–µ –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ, —Ä–µ–∫–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥—É—é', # Positive 99.996%
    '–í —Ü–µ–ª–æ–º –ø–æ–π–¥–µ—Ç'           # Positive 64.878%
]

for review in example_reviews:
    pos, neg = model.process_review(review)
    print(review + ':')
    print(' Positive:', pos)
    print(' Negative:', neg)
```
